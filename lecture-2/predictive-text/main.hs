{-| The T9 mode of mobile phones makes it easier to enter text on keyboards:
instead of tapping a key several times to scroll through the letters, a single
keystroke is enough and the phone automatically suggests the words that
correspond to the sequence of keys that have just been typed, from a dictionary
that it has in memory.

-------------------------
|       |  ABC  |  DEF  |
|   1   |   2   |   3   |
-------------------------
|  GHI  |  JKL  |  MNO  |
|   4   |   5   |   6   |
-------------------------
| PQRS  |  TUV  | WXYZ  |
|   7   |   8   |   9   |
-------------------------
|       |       |       |
|   *   |   0   |   #   |
-------------------------
For example, by successively typing the keys 8, 6, 4, 2, 6, 7 and 6 you would
obtain the word "unicorn". It is possible for a sequence of keys to correspond
to several words  Thus, the sequence 6, 6, 6 and 6 corresponds to the words
"mono","noon",and "moon".

The goal of this exercise is to program an efficient solution for finding
dictionary words that match a keystroke. To do this, we will represent the
dictionary by a digital tree data structure, or a Trie.

In a trie, each branch is labeled by the number of a telephone key and each
node by the words of the dictionary corresponding to the sequence of keys
leading from the root of the tree to this node.

For example, the tree that we obtain for the small computer dictionary
composed of the words {hd, if, in, get, to, void, unit} is the following:

                        {}
                       /  \
 		     4/    \8
  		     /      \
		   {}        {}
		  /  \        \
		6/    \3       \6
		/      \        \
	      {in}   {if,hd}    {to}
	                |        |
			|8       |4
			|        |
		      {get}     { }
		               /   \
			     3/     \8
			     /       \
			  {void}    {unit}

-}

{-| To represent such a digital tree, we define the following type in Haskell: -}

data Trie = Trie { wordlist :: [String], branches :: [(Int, Trie)] }

{-| ie each node of the tree is a record where the words field contains the list
of words corresponding to this node and where the branches field is a list
of pairs associating digital trees with integers
(this is precisely called an association list ).

To access fields, we can just use functional application, i.e. for a value
(t :: Trie) we can write (branches t) :: [(Int, Trie)].

To obtain a value where a field is updated, we can use the following syntax:

 t { wordlist = ["a"] }
 t { wordlist = "a":(wordlist t) }

so that we have for instance

wordlist (empty {wordlist = "a":(wordlist empty)}) == ["a"]. -}
